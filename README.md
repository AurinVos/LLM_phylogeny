# LLM_phylogeny

A repository to show the phylogeny of LLMs based on technical innovations starting from "Attention Is All You Need".

## Interacting with the graph

The interactive graph can be explored in any modern web browser once you start the development server (see project documentation for the exact command). The main controls are:

- **Pan:** Click and drag anywhere on the canvas to reposition the graph.
- **Zoom:** Use the mouse wheel or trackpad pinch gesture to zoom in and out smoothly.
- **Node details:** Click a node to highlight it and reveal its metadata in the sidebar panel.
- **Reset view:** Press the reset control in the UI (or refresh the page) to return to the default zoom and position.

If you prefer keyboard navigation, the arrow keys nudge the viewport, while `+` and `-` adjust the zoom level. These controls replace the previous static screenshot and give an up-to-date description of how to interact with the visualization.
